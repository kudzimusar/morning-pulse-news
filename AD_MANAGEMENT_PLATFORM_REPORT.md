## 6. Security & Permissions

### 6.1 Firestore Security Rules

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The current `firestore.rules` file does **NOT** include specific rules for advertisers and ads collections. This means:

- **Current State:** Default deny (all access blocked)
- **Required Action:** Add security rules for:
  - `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/advertisers/{uid}`
  - `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/ads/{adId}`

### 6.2 Recommended Security Rules

```javascript
// Advertisers Collection
match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/advertisers/{uid} {
  // Advertisers can read their own profile
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;
  // Admins can read all advertisers
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  // Anyone can create during registration
  allow create: if request.auth.uid == uid;
  // Only admins can update (approve/reject)
  allow update: if isAdmin();
  // Only admins can delete
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}

// Ads Collection
match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/ads/{adId} {
  // Public can read active ads (for display)
  allow read: if resource.data.status == 'active';
  // Advertisers can read their own ads
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                 resource.data.advertiserId == request.auth.uid;
  // Admins can read all ads
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  // Approved advertisers can create ads
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                   get(/databases/$(database)/documents/artifacts/$(appId)/public/data/advertisers/$(request.auth.uid)).data.status == 'approved';
  // Only admins can update (approve/reject/activate)
  allow update: if isAdmin();
  // Only admins can delete
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

### 6.3 Authentication Requirements

- **Advertiser Registration:** Creates Firebase Auth account
- **Advertiser Login:** Email/password authentication
- **Status Verification:** System checks advertiser approval status before dashboard access
- **Admin Access:** Requires Super Admin role in staff collection

## 10. Integration Points

### 10.1 Website Integration

- **Header Navigation:** "Advertise" link in main navigation
- **Footer:** Advertising information and links
- **Ad Display:** AdSlot component for placeholder ads
- **Routing:** Integrated into main App.tsx routing system

### 10.2 Admin Dashboard Integration

- **Real-time Updates:** Firestore subscriptions for live data

---

## 11. Current Limitations & Recommendations

### 11.1 Security Rules Missing

**Critical:** Firestore security rules for advertisers and ads collections are not defined. This will block all operations.

**Recommendation:** Add security rules as outlined in Section 6.2.

### 11.2 Payment Processing

**Status:** Payment status tracking exists, but no payment gateway integration.

**Recommendation:** Integrate payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) or manual payment verification workflow.

### 11.3 Ad Display Implementation

**Status:** AdSlot component exists but shows placeholder only.

**Recommendation:** Implement ad rendering logic that:
- Fetches active ads based on placement
- Displays ad creatives
- Tracks views and clicks
- Handles ad expiration

### 11.4 Email Notifications

**Status:** No email notifications for:
- Advertiser approval/rejection
- Ad approval/rejection
- Payment confirmations

**Recommendation:** Integrate email service (Firebase Cloud Functions + SendGrid/SES) for notifications.

### 11.5 Analytics Enhancement

**Current:** Basic view/click counting

**Recommendation:** Add:
- Time-based analytics (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Click-through rate (CTR) calculation
- Conversion tracking
- Geographic analytics
- Device/browser analytics

### 11.6 Ad Expiration Automation

**Status:** Manual expiration handling

**Recommendation:** Implement Cloud Function to automatically update ad status to 'expired' when end date passes.
