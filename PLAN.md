# Morning Pulse - Editorial Workflow Plan

**Last Updated**: January 18, 2026  
**Status**: In Implementation  
**Phase**: Professional Newsroom Workflow

---

## Overview

This document serves as the single source of truth for all development decisions related to the Morning Pulse editorial workflow system.

## Current Implementation: 5-Stage Editorial Workflow

### Goals
- Implement a professional newsroom workflow (Writer → Editor → Public)
- Support collaborative editing with claim/lock mechanism
- Enable draft management for writers
- Provide scheduled publishing for editors
- Add feedback loop between editors and writers

---

## Data Schema

### Opinion Interface (types.ts)

**New Fields Added:**
```typescript
authorId?: string;           // Firebase UID of the journalist/writer
status: 'draft' | 'pending' | 'in-review' | 'published' | 'archived';
editorNotes?: string;         // Feedback from editor to writer
scheduledFor?: Date | null;   // Future publish timestamp
claimedBy?: string | null;    // Editor UID who claimed the story
claimedAt?: Date | null;      // When the story was claimed
originalBody?: string;        // Store original text for reference
```

**Existing Fields (Retained):**
- All previous fields remain for backward compatibility
- `authorName` still used for display
- `writerType` indicates editorial vs guest submissions

---

## 5-Stage Workflow Pipeline

| Stage | Status Value | Description | Visible To | Actions Available |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1. Draft | `draft` | Writer is composing | Writer only | Save, Submit for Review |
| 2. Pending Review | `pending` | Awaiting editor claim | Editors | Claim, Reject |
| 3. In Edit | `in-review` | Editor is working on it | Assigned Editor | Edit, Return to Writer, Publish |
| 4. Ready to Publish | `published` | Live on site | Public | Unpublish, Archive |
| 5. Archived | `archived` | Removed from active site | Admins | Restore, Delete |

---

## Key Features

### 1. Claim/Lock System
- When editor clicks "Claim", story status changes to `in-review`
- `claimedBy` field stores editor's UID
- Other editors see "Claimed by [Name]" and cannot edit
- Editor can "Release" claim to return story to pending

### 2. Draft Management
- Writers save stories as `draft` (not visible in editor queue)
- Writers click "Submit for Review" to change status to `pending`
- Drafts visible only in Writer Dashboard

### 3. Split-Pane Editor
- Left pane: Original journalist text (read-only reference)
- Right pane: Editor's version (editable)
- Highlights differences for transparency

### 4. Editor Feedback Loop
- Editors add notes in `editorNotes` field
- "Return to Writer" button changes status to `pending` with notes
- Writer sees notes in their dashboard

### 5. Scheduled Publishing
- Editors set `scheduledFor` timestamp
- Cloud Function publishes automatically at scheduled time
- Status shows "Scheduled for [Date/Time]"

### 6. Permissions Guard
- **Publish Button**: `admin` or `editor` roles only
- **Submit for Review**: `writer` role
- **Claim Stories**: `editor` or `admin` roles only

---

## File Structure

### Modified Files
1. **types.ts** - Updated Opinion interface
2. **opinionStatus.ts** - 5-stage status mappings
3. **EditorialQueueTab.tsx** - Sections for Drafts/Pending/In-Review
4. **opinionsService.ts** - New workflow functions
5. **WriterDashboard.tsx** - Draft support, feedback display
6. **authService.ts** - Writer role validation

### New Functions (opinionsService.ts)
```typescript
claimStory(storyId: string, editorId: string, editorName: string)
releaseStory(storyId: string)
returnToWriter(storyId: string, editorNotes: string)
schedulePublication(storyId: string, scheduledFor: Date)
submitForReview(storyId: string) // Changes draft → pending
```
